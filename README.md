# forum-app

This is a forum application where users can register, login once their data is stored in the database, and engage in various activities such as posting, editing, and deleting questions. Users can also answer questions, with options to edit, like, dislike, and delete their answers.

The application is built using React for the frontend and backed by MongoDB for the database. To get started, ensure you have MongoDB installed. Additionally, create a .env file with the following variables:
<br>
<br>
PORT: Port number for the server;
<br>
DB_CONNECTION_STRING: Connection string for the MongoDB database;
<br>
DB_NAME: Name of the MongoDB database;

Once you have set up MongoDB and created the .env file, simply run npm install in both the backend and frontend directories to install the required dependencies.
